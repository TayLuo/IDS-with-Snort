# IDS-with-Snort

SNORT is a powerful open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) 
that provides real-time network traffic analysis and data packet logging. SNORT uses a rule-based language 
that combines anomaly, protocol, and signature inspection methods to detect potentially malicious activity.

# Introduction-with-Snort
This is an introduction of Snort. The following guide will show how to install Snort, 
configure and write custom rules. Snort has three primary uses: As a packet sniffer

or it can be used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system.
