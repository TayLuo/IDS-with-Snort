# IDS-with-Snort

SNORT is a powerful open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) 
that provides real-time network traffic analysis and data packet logging. SNORT uses a rule-based language 
that combines anomaly, protocol, and signature inspection methods to detect potentially malicious activity.
